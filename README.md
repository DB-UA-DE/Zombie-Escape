# Zombie-Escape
This is a SRB2 mod with custom gametype created
mainly for netgames. At first it was created in 2020 (probably)
and then multiple ZE servers did use it.
The first creator is TuXe but most of the 
newer maps were created
by Hamitto.

If anyone wants, contribute to this
project, we would be happy to accept anything equitable.

__" I recently removed support for the extra characters such as scarf, xtreme and the pizza chars.
In the source file, go to **extra/ExtraCharConfig** for the support for those extra characters. Thank you.
The reason we detatched these is because they are mods irrelevant to zombie escape, and was here for server hosting.
I'm going to start removing server resources that has no relation to zombie escape. Since it is considered bloating.
Thank you "__ - Jisk

# Zombie-Escape
This is a SRB2 mod with custom gametype created
mainly for netgames. At first it was created in 2020 (probably)
and then multiple ZE servers did use it.
The first creator is TuXe but most of the 
newer maps were created
by Hamitto.

If anyone wants, contribute to this
project, we would be happy to accept anything equitable.
